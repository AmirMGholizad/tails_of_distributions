# **Extreme Events of Fat-tailed Distributions** #

This project has been designed as the final task for the course
CMSC6950 at the Memorial University of Newfoundland.

In this project we aim to define a feature for fat-tailed distributions
that might be a proper measure of volatility in financial markets.

All functions used in the project are defined in `functions.py` python script.

Dependancies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. A couple of "unnecessary" dependencies not available? then use `cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 pip install` to skip them.
